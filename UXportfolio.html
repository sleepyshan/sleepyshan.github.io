        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        The ease of purchase has made it a lot easier for customers to buy from the food truck, increasing their reputation and business in a positive way.

I have learned that improving accessibility in my designs will end up assisting a lot more people, and should keep this in mind moving forward when updating this app in future.
